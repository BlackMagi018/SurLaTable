# SurLaTable
CIS 350 Group Project - Sur La Table 
That's french for on the table and is a reference to South Park so i thought it'd be funny.

I was working out kind of a flow chart describing how i think the app should work.

1. Landing Page
    Displays a logo, with buttons for login as a register user and a button to create a new user. Also link for users who forgot their         password.
    
2. Once the users login they're taken to a page with three options

   i. Feed Me Now  - Brings up all the supported restaurants in a 10 mile area and allows user to find something to eat right away
   ii. Find A Table - Allows users to search for restaurants based on Location, Cuisine, Price, or Dress Code.
   iii. Plan A Meal  - Users input a specific restuarant, reserve a table and if desired view menu and preorder their meal.
